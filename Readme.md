# United Airlines Call Center Optimization

## Overview
This project aims to optimize the call center operations for United Airlines by analyzing key metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT), Average Speed of Answer (AST), call reasons, and sentiments. The solution involves data exploration, key drivers analysis, call reason categorization, IVR optimization, and actionable recommendations.

## Data Exploration
1. **Loading and Examining the Dataset**: Understand key metrics like AHT, AST, call reasons, and sentiments.
2. **Data Quality Issues**: Identify missing values or outliers.
3. **Calculations**: Compute AHT and AST using the provided formulas.

## Key Drivers Analysis
1. **AHT Analysis**:
    - Agent performance
    - Call duration
    - Silence percentage
    - Sentiment (agent and customer tones)
2. **AST Analysis**:
    - Peak hours
    - Agent availability

## Call Reason Categorization
1. **NLP Techniques**:
    - Keyword extraction
    - Clustering
2. **Pattern Identification**: Identify recurring issues.
3. **Self-Service IVR**: Evaluate problems that can be handled via IVR to reduce agent involvement.

## IVR Optimization
1. **Findings-Based Improvements**: Enhance IVR categorization to prevent simple issues from escalating to agents.
2. **Efficiency Enhancement**: Improve overall call center efficiency.

## Predictive Model (Optional)
1. **Classification**: Build a model to classify primary call reasons using features like call duration, sentiment, and tones.
2. **Predictions**: Submit predictions with the test data.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. **Optimize AHT and AST**: Provide strategies to improve these metrics.
2. **Agent Training**: Suggest improvements in training programs.
3. **Refine IVR Flows**: Enhance IVR processes based on analysis.

## Summary
Summarize findings in a data-driven, concise presentation to support the recommendations.
